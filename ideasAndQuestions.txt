ideas for figures: show pictures of outlier/unusual images of the fashion mnist data set. can do this by finding
images that are furthest away from the average of the data set (or some other method) mnist has unusual handwritten 
digits, some 5's will look all squiggly or weird (there must be the equivalent in fashion mnist). 
show standard images of fashion mnist
show time to train and accuracy across different numbers of models
kmeans visualization do clustering then project to 2d, use a sample to visualize what classes belong to each cluster
ex: sample 100 images. you will see some cluster have mostly sweaters for example (maybe 5 sweaters, and 2 shoes belong to
one cluster, and then another cluster has 5 pants and 3 shirts) this can be used to illustrate the effects of clustering

show confidence interval for accuracy over different numbers of models to train
also show confidence interval for time over different numer of models to train, do this both for
mixture of experts with kmeans time included, mixture of experts without kmeans time included, kmeans training time,
and ensemble method time
^^^The idea behind this is that kmeans takes a long time to compute, but in the real world it will probably only be
computed once, whereas training mixture of experts may be done many times, for finding the best parameters (ex: learning
rate)
MAKE SURE to save data for training time taken on each fold for mixture of experts and for the kmeans, 
so we can combine their times to get a confidence interval of them combined, and also show graphs of the intervals
for them seperately.
what should we assume is the reader's understanding? answer: a class mate. we only need to explain mixture of experts
and ensemble method as a result
